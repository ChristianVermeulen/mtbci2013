MTBCI 2013
===============

With this little script we can see each others commits on the big screen!

Adding your repo
--------
Add the following URL as Webhook URL in your repo settings: `http://hrprojecten.net/newcommit.php`.
Test the hook to add your last 3 commits.

Todo
--------
Here are some more ideas to make this even better:

- Add hrefs to titles
- Add the Countdown timer
- Show user statistics (e.g.: # of commits)

Feel free to work on any of these or add your own to this list.

Just fork and send me pull requests and I will keep everything up to date.

Keep track of them on the [issuetracker](https://github.com/christianvermeulen/mtbci2013/issues?state=open)!
